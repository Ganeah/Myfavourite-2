      <h1>My favourite hobby reading</h1>
      <p>Reading gives me more knowledge and luck and reading a book removes 65% stress doing the math and english problems are very fun but if I didn't read then how would I do if the quizes of english and math problems it would be hard and tough and even how would I do exams if I didn't study exams would be tough and get bad grades like F+ D- C- C+ but If I study then I would get good grades like B- B+ A- and A+ and I get A+ because I work hard.For example if the highest marks is 30 and I get 29/30 28/30 27/30 or even 26/30 but the highest marks I get is 30/30 and if there are any mistakes on the exam sheet I tell mam that mam here is the mistake on the exam sheet and dictation and I need write the dictation words I would go through the book and underline the words and go through the words but in our school If a word mistake is there they say to write it 5 times.</p>
